# profileManagementApplication
A Profile Management App built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS based on a Figma design. It displays a grid of profile cards showing name, avatar, and short bio. Clicking a card opens a detailed profile page with complete user info and a back button. Backend APIs provide data for all profiles and individual profiles by ID.
